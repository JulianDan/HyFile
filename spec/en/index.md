# HyFile

HyFile is a universal standard designed to integrate files from different sources and provide an efficient solution for synchronization, backup, and searching.

## Database

HyFile utilizes SQLite as its database, which is a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional database engine. It enables the implementation of HyFile in both underlying standards and higher-level applications.

## Objects

HyFile follows the concept of "everything is an object". In HyFile, files, directories, folders, backups, storage sources, and others are all considered objects.

Each object has its own universally unique identifier (UUID) along with various attributes.
